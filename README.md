# mailsaviour-spec

This repo contains the specification for our (or hopefully all) mail save systems developed in this course: https://www.dcl.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/teaching/SRE/

The spec itself is located at `spec.yml` and is written in the OpenAPI 3.0 format. You can create these files with every text editor and the IDE-like web editor at https://editor.swagger.io

Feel free to create your own fork and/or submit Pull Request so we are using all the same specs. If you have any questions don't hesitate to contact us.
